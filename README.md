- A distributed system to collect and process events from several sources
- Some creative coding
- AI driven projects for visual elements recognition

**🌻 I'm learning about...**

- Software architecture
- LLM
- Machine learning
- UI/UX
- Immersive web applications (with 3D elements and animations)
- Golang
- Digital illustration

**🦄 Other stuff that I love:**

- I play in an alternative rock band so I love music (making, producing, recording, writing, etc...)
- Analog photography
- Reading (novels in general, fictions, sci-fi, poetry, philosophy)
- Playing chill and creative games
- Riding my bike around the city
